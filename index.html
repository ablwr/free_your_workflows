               	Librarians and archivists love good documentation. 
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
                  To begin, we’re going to assume two things as “given” about librarians and archivists. The first is that we love, or maybe just like, documentation. What I mean by documentation in this context is the articulation of the steps or processes followed in order to accomplish a task. To be even more specific, what I’m thinking of when I say documentation is an object- a PDF or a readme in markdown are two examples I can think of although I’m sure it is created in plenty of other formats as well. A large part of many librarians and archivists work is to figure out how something is done (how materials are accessioned, processed, or digitized for example), and translate those steps into a piece of documentation, which is usually kept internal to the institution.

              <p>
               	Librarians and archivists care about making information accessible.
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
                  The second assumption is that we care about making information accessible to others. This is sort of a fundamental principle of librarianship, and although it certainly becomes more complicated in practice, we typically describe the library and archive work that we do in service of access. 
              	
              </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
              <p>
               	These two concepts often are not paired together. 
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
                  Yet, often, these two things don’t necessarily go hand and hand with each other. We’re more concerned, and rightly so, with making our materials accessible to patrons. But, I think it's possible that if we focused on making our processes and workflows more accessible to each other, this could also impact how we can make more materials more accessible.

              <aside class="notes">
                To contextualize the rest of our talk, it might be good to lay down some definitions, so that we’re all on the same page when we’re talking about these technologies. Each of these terms or concepts that we’ll talk about play an important role in opening workflows.

                  open source
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
              	First, what do we mean by open source? The open source initiative defines open source software as “software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified and unmodified form) by anyone.”

                  open access
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
                This is where open access becomes important too. What we mean by open access is unrestricted access to information. open access is commonly used in the world of academic publishing to denote a work that is freely available to read without subscription to journals or databases. The same applies to code- people have to be able to find and download the source code. Combining these two words, we’re thinking here specifically of open source software that is freely available to download from code repositories like GitHub. We’ll talk more specifically about open source software for audio visual materials later in this talk.

                  open file formats
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
              	Open file formats are a third significant component. A file format defines the structure and type of data that is stored in a file. An open file format, then, is the openly accessible, publicly published specification for the structure and storage. Open file formats are usually maintained by a standards organization. An open file format is platform independent, meaning that it can be used across software and operating systems. using an open file format with publicly available specifications is necessary  in digital preservation, as it allows for us to continue to render digital objects as operating systems and software changes, which is crucial in combating obsolescence.
