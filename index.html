               	Librarians and archivists love good documentation. 
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
                  To begin, we’re going to assume two things as “given” about librarians and archivists. The first is that we love, or maybe just like, documentation. What I mean by documentation in this context is the articulation of the steps or processes followed in order to accomplish a task. To be even more specific, what I’m thinking of when I say documentation is an object- a PDF or a readme in markdown are two examples I can think of although I’m sure it is created in plenty of other formats as well. A large part of many librarians and archivists work is to figure out how something is done (how materials are accessioned, processed, or digitized for example), and translate those steps into a piece of documentation, which is usually kept internal to the institution.

              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
                  The second assumption is that we care about making information accessible to others. This is sort of a fundamental principle of librarianship, and although it certainly becomes more complicated in practice, we typically describe the library and archive work that we do in service of access.

               	These two concepts often are not paired together. 
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
                  Yet, often, these two things don’t necessarily go hand and hand with each other. We’re more concerned, and rightly so, with making our materials accessible to patrons. But, I think it's possible that if we focused on making our processes and workflows more accessible to each other, this could also impact how we can make more materials more accessible.

                Writing documentation is hard! It’s a real skill to bridge the gap between a code base and human comprehension.

                <aside class="notes">
                It’s also scary to put things out there on the internet. There’s a shared sense of imposter syndrome, regardless of the effort made or size of the institution, that the code will be “not good enough.” Not enough tests, the code “isn’t clean enough,” or not enough documentation.

                <aside class="notes">
                It can also be hard to deal with feedback. Of course dealing with negative feedback is hard, but even having to spend time answering questions or clarifying or helping other people use your codebase takes time that is likely not allocated and dedicated to that cause.

                A/V

                <aside class="notes">
                On top of all of this, a/v is *really* hard compared to text or images, especially when someone is more of a generalist. Codecs wrappers, format migration, the differences between digital and analog, or even trying to answer *what video is* can be challenging. From an archival standpoint, quick initial accessioning just isn’t a reality because in analog video and some digital video, files can’t even be played back prior to migration. And once analog materials are migrated to a stable digital format, the filesizes are huge. And their care can be made further burdensome by a diverse range of formats, and there’s no one generally accepted archival-grade format. Just a lot of opinions. And not one format is gonna work for every institution.

                To contextualize the rest of our talk, it might be good to lay down some definitions, so that we’re all on the same page when we’re talking about these technologies. Each of these terms or concepts that we’ll talk about play an important role in opening workflows.

              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
              	First, what do we mean by open source? The open source initiative defines open source software as “software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified and unmodified form) by anyone.”

                  open access
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
                This is where open access becomes important too. What we mean by open access is unrestricted access to information. open access is commonly used in the world of academic publishing to denote a work that is freely available to read without subscription to journals or databases. The same applies to code- people have to be able to find and download the source code. Combining these two words, we’re thinking here specifically of open source software that is freely available to download from code repositories like GitHub. We’ll talk more specifically about open source software for audio visual materials later in this talk.

                  open file formats
              </p>
              <aside class="notes">
              	Open file formats are a third significant component. A file format defines the structure and type of data that is stored in a file. An open file format, then, is the openly accessible, publicly published specification for the structure and storage. Open file formats are usually maintained by a standards organization. An open file format is platform independent, meaning that it can be used across software and operating systems. using an open file format with publicly available specifications is necessary  in digital preservation, as it allows for us to continue to render digital objects as operating systems and software changes, which is crucial in combating obsolescence.

                <aside class="notes">
                	When thinking again about the gap between theory and practice, a lot of this weighs more heavily if the codebase burden is just on one person or institution, and can be alleviated when a project exists collaboratively.

                  	More likely to keep project alive and thriving when many people care about it. As librarians, I think we’re familiar with vendor lock keeping an institution locked into one system by preventing free access to their own data. But with our software, we should be aware of institution-lock. How can we create things that can be extended to other institutions?

                    At NYPL, on my team, we really strive for a microservices approach to development. We want to have the ability to switch out any one part of a project for something better that comes along, and not have everything tangled up in one, overly large application. And we do this by having clear end-points to send data from one place to another.  What better way to know that one software component of your overall workflow can be swapped out in the future than if it can also easily be swapped into another institution's code base?

                	MediaConch is another project I’m on. It’s for video file conformance checking. It’s so your video files are what they say they are. This is funded by the European Commission, and the software is required to be open source. With MediaConch, we work in the open. Very, very in the open. There is plenty of really gnarly XSLs written by yours truly in our repos, which are all public.

                    MediaConch is based out of MediaInfo, which is… I’d say the most-used media microservice among information professionals. MediaInfo gives you information about your files! But more importantly, it does it very quickly, and even works on partial files that are in transit. So it’s very easy to integrate MediaInfo into much larger projects (and this is what we intend to do with MediaConch too).

                    An example of integration of these tools is within Artefactual’s Archivematica, which uses mediainfo and will soon be using mediaconch, as part of the suite of services that get files into digital long-term preservation-level storage.

                    ffmprovisr is a good example of a small project that helps many people at a lot of different institutions, and has had work contributed by people at many institutions. It’s a platform for sharing very small scripts. I had made this project on my own for fun, but I was usually too lazy to work on it. I pitched it at the last AMIA conference and now it’s a fairly active project. It got restructured and made better on the day with a team of around 10 people, and I hope that people feel a certain ownership of the project, which I transferred to the amiaopensource Github account. And there’s been a lot of collaboration in the Issues section and through pull requests, even with contributions from FFmpeg contributors.
